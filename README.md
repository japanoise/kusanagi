# kusanagi

>Who slips into my robot body and whispers to my ghost?

kusanagi is a Golang chess engine. It's not ready yet. Girls do their best now
and are preparing. Please wait warmly until it is ready.

## status

kusanagi has a working movegen, verified by dorpsgek's xboard version of 
[this](http://www.rocechess.ch/perft.html) perft  test suite. This should provide
a solid basis going forward to create a working engine.

## credits

kusanagi hacked together by japanoise, with a great deal of help from
ZirconiumX - thank you, without you this wouldn't be possible.

I'd also like to thank the humans of freenode's ##chessprogramming, for being a
programming community that actually builds stuff and discusses building stuff.
You guys rock.
