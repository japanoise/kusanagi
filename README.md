# kusanagi

>Who slips into my robot body and whispers to my ghost?

kusanagi is a Golang chess engine. It's not ready yet. Girls do their best now
and are preparing. Please wait warmly until it is ready.

## status

As of the 100th commit, daed2d3, kusanagi is a working chess engine! Of course,
due to many, many issues it's a very weak engine - you'll not struggle to beat
it if you can play chess. For the curious, a pgn file of the first on-record
chess game played by kusanagi is available in the games/ directory of this
repository.

My mentor/partner-in-crime, ZirconiumX, is filing possible future improvements as
issues. I plan to categorize these by the MoSCoW method. Any help on any of
these is greatly appreciated.

## credits

kusanagi hacked together by japanoise, with a great deal of help from
ZirconiumX - thank you, without you this wouldn't be possible.

I'd also like to thank the humans of freenode's ##chessprogramming, for being a
programming community that actually builds stuff and discusses building stuff.
You guys rock.
